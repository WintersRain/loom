# Update World

Append new worldbuilding details to `world.md`.

## When to Use

- After worldbuild agent generates content
- When new locations/factions/lore are established in play
- User explicitly adds world details
- Canonizing improvised details

## What to Log

- Locations (new or expanded)
- Factions/Groups
- History/Lore
- Rules of the world (magic systems, social structures, etc.)
- Important NPCs
- Cultural details

## Format

Append to the appropriate section in world.md, or create a new section:

```markdown

## [CATEGORY]

### [ENTRY NAME]

[Content from worldbuild agent or established in play]

*Established: Scene [X] / worldbuild agent*
```

## Organization

world.md should have these sections:
- Locations
- Factions & Groups
- Characters (NPCs)
- History & Lore
- World Rules
- Miscellaneous

Create sections as needed.

## Rules

- Never contradict established facts
- Note where details came from (scene # or agent)
- Keep formatting consistent
- Cross-reference related entries
