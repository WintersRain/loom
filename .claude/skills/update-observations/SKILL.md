# Update Observations

Append new observations about MC to `observations.md`.

## When to Use

After analyzing MC's actions and determining what the character noticed or learned.

## What to Log

- Physical details noticed
- Behavioral patterns observed
- Preferences revealed
- Tells identified (lying, nervous, comfortable)
- New information about MC's history/situation
- Things that made MC react

## Format to Append

```markdown

### [Scene Reference] - [Brief Context]
- [What character observed]
- [What they learned about MC]
- [New detail about MC's preferences/habits]
```

## Rules

- Only add NEW observations
- Don't duplicate existing entries
- Be specific, not vague
- Write from character's perspective (what THEY noticed, not omniscient)
- Include why it matters to the character
