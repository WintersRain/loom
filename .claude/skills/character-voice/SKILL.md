# Character Voice Guidelines

## Voice Components

Every character voice has these elements:

### 1. Formality Level
- **Formal**: Complete sentences, titles, no contractions
- **Casual**: Contractions, slang, incomplete sentences
- **Shifts**: Changes based on audience or stress

### 2. Vocabulary
- **Simple**: Common words, short sentences
- **Educated**: Complex vocabulary, varied syntax
- **Technical**: Jargon from their expertise
- **Archaic**: Older speech patterns, dated phrases

### 3. Rhythm
- **Quick**: Short sentences, rapid delivery
- **Measured**: Balanced pacing, natural flow
- **Deliberate**: Pauses, weight on words

### 4. Emotional Display
- **Expressive**: Emotions visible in speech
- **Restrained**: Controlled, emotions leak through
- **Hidden**: Masks true feelings

## Voice Markers to Track

For each character, identify:

1. **Signature phrases** - What do they say often?
2. **Verbal tics** - Filler words, repeated patterns
3. **Address style** - How do they refer to others?
4. **Forbidden words** - What would they NEVER say?
5. **Stress responses** - How speech changes under pressure

## Dialogue Quality Checklist

Before finalizing dialogue, verify:

- [ ] Would THIS character say this, or is it generic?
- [ ] Is the formality level consistent?
- [ ] Are contractions used appropriately for this character?
- [ ] Does sentence length match their speech pattern?
- [ ] Would swapping names break the dialogue (if yes, it's too generic)?

## Common Voice Breaks

**Avoid these:**
- Character suddenly using vocabulary outside their education
- Formal character using slang without reason
- Consistent verbal tics disappearing
- Speech patterns shifting without emotional cause
- Monologuing when character is normally terse
